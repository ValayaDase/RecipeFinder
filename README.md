<b><i>Recipe Finder<i><b>
<br>
Recipe Finder is a React-based web application that allows users to search for recipes based on dish names. It fetches data from a public recipe API and displays a list of matching meals with images, names. Users can click on a recipe card to view detailed information like ingredients, instructions, and cooking methods in a popup/modal. The UI is responsive and user-friendly, offering a smooth and interactive experience.
